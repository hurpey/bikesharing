Des Moines NYC Citibike Analysis

•	Overview of the analysis:

The purpose of this analysis is to create additional visualizations that will enhance and solidify our business proposal to investors for the proposed Des Moines bike-sharing program. 

To solidify the proposal, one of the key stakeholders would like to see a bike trip analysis showing the following:
•	The length of time that bikes are checked out for all riders and genders.
•	The number of bike trips for all riders and genders for each hour of each day of the week
•	The number of bike trips for each type of user and gender for each day of the week.


•	Results:
